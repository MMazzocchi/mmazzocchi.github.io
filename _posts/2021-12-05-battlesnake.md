title: A Year of Battlesnake
---

Almost exactly a year ago, I discovered [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com). For the unfamiliar, Battlesnake is basically competitive programming. It's based on the classic game [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28video_game_genre%29) except instead of one snake there are a bunch, and instead of _you_ playing, it's an API you built.

Battlesnake is a competition; each game results in up to one winner and zero or more losers. In 2021, there were four tournaments, and I was fortunate enough to be relatively successful in most of them:

* **Spring 2021** - 1v1 Finalist, Gold Tournament
* **Summer 2021** - Competitor, Elite Tournament
* **Fall 2021** - Competitor, Platinum Tournament
* **Winter 2021** - Invited to Elite Tournament *(results TBD!)*

I'm most proud, however, to say that I acheived these results **without any machine learning** libraries or excessive computing resources; just old-fashioned logic, running on a single docker container, deployed to a little cloud server! I think machine learning is a great technology with interesting applications, but sometimes it feels good to go head-to-head with the machine.

I'm hoping to spend some time in the next few months cleaning up my Battlesnake repo and blogging about it.
